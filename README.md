# In-Network Computing Simulator for Parallel Programming
This program is designed to simulate a parallel computing system based on fat-tree topology with in-network computing capability.

#### What is in-network computing?
An in-network computing capable system can perform tasks within the network infrastructure, rather than exclusively at the endpoints.

#### Why do we need it?
There are a couple of reasons behind this concept.
1. **Reduced Latency:** By processing data within the network, in-network computing can significantly reduce latency. This is because data does not need to travel back and forth between endpoints for processing.
2. **Bandwidth Efficiency:** It can optimize bandwidth usage by processing data locally, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the network.
3. **Energy Efficiency:** By reducing the need for data to traverse long distances to centralized data centers, in-network computing can lead to energy savings, making it a more sustainable solution for large-scale data processing.
